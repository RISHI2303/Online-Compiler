# Online Compiler

This is a basic website that allows you to compile code online. It is not a full-featured compiler, but it is a good starting point for learning how to use the compiler.

This website is an assignment from **CodeQuotient Platform**. It uses **API** and **AJAX** calls to compile your code.

---
It currently supports the following 5 languages:

* C
* C++
* Python
* Java
* JavaScript

---

## Limitations

* `User Input`: It is not possible to give input to the program.

* `File Input`: It is not possible to read from files.

* `Debugging`: It is not possible to debug the program.

* `UI`: User Interface can be improved further.
